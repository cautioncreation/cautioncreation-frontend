JAMStack has been taking the online world by storm, but if you don't build websites for a living you've probably never heard of it. Even international companies such as Shopify are expressing support for this new way of building modern, reliable websites. Read on to learn how JAMstack can transform your online business.

## WTF is JAMStack?

JAMStack isn't a single technology, it's a way of thinking. First, a bit of background: When you click a link to a new website, what's actually happening is your website is sending a request to the server with that URL asking for a specific page, for example the home page. 

With traditional websites, when the server receives the request, it grabs the template for the page you're requesting (the home page template) and fills in all of the required information. In many cases, this requires the server to get information from other places, such as other websites or a database. Of course this takes time, and as you know time is money. Once all of the data has been retrieved it is added to the template and the whole page is sent back to your computer.

JAMStack works differently. Instead of recreating the page every time someone wants to view it, JAMStack uses a build process. A build process means that any time a change is made to the data that a website needs - for example a new product is added to an online store - JAMStack will automatically re-build the site and store the results.

## Okay, But Why Does That Matter?﻿

At first glance, the benefits may not appear to be worth it, but let me explain to you why they are. I will do that using an important fact: For each second your website load time increases, your online business will lose 7% of their customers. So, while three seconds may not seem like a lot of time, it can mean a 21% increase in sales, which can be the difference between a business breaking even or thriving.

## What Else Can JAMStack do?

If increased sales and decreased loading times aren't enough to sway you, JAMStack has a bunch more to offer. I'll list them, and then go into detail below:﻿﻿
* Lower maintenance costs 


* Lower maintenance costs 
* Separation of concerns
* Increased website security
* Ability to rapidly scale

#### Lower Maintenance Costs
As explained above, because JAMStack websites use a build process they no longer require expensive databases and dynamic servers to operate. In many cases the files for your site can be hosted for FREE using services such as [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

#### Increased Website Security
Not only are databases and dynamic servers expensive but they are also more vulnerable to attack due to the amount of moving parts - and the potentially sensitive information passing between them. 

We should clarify, JAMStack doesn't mean that there are no dynamic servers or databases, it means that in cases when they are required we mainly rely on SaaS (software as a service) companies to provide them, no coding required. Companies such as [Contentful](https://contentful.com) and [Shopify](https://shopify.com) will meet our requirements while lowering our monthly costs and increasing our security. Because these reputable companies are taking care of our servers, we can rest assured that security is of utmost importance.

#### Ability to Rapidly Scale
Because we aren't dealing with custom code on our servers every time we need a new functionality on our site, and instead are relying on SaaS companies, we can scale faster than ever before. Adding a new feature to our site is as simple as finding a SaaS provider that supports it and setting up an account.

Rapidly scaling also means that your business can handle any amount of traffic
