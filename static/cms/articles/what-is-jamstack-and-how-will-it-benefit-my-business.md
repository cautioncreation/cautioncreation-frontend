JAMStack has been taking the online world by storm, but if you don't build websites for a living you've probably never heard of it. Even international companies such as Shopify are expressing support for this new way of building modern, reliable websites. Read on to learn how JAMstack can transform your online business.

## WTF is JAMStack?
JAMStack isn't a single technology, it's a way of thinking. First, a bit of background: When you click a link to a new website, what's actually happening is your website is sending a request to the server with that URL asking for a specific page, for example the home page. 

With traditional websites, when the server receives the request, it grabs the template for the page you're requesting (the home page template) and fills in all of the required information. In many cases, this requires the server to get information from other places, such as other websites or a database. Of course this takes time, and as you know time is money. Once all of the data has been retrieved it is added to the template and the whole page is sent back to your computer.

JAMStack works differently. Instead of recreating the page every time someone wants to view it, JAMStack uses a build process. A build process means that any time a change is made to the data that a website needs - for example a new product is added to an online store - JAMStack will automatically re-build the site and store the results.

## Okay, But Why Does That Matter?
At first glance, the benefits may not appear to be worth it, but let me explain to you why they are. I will do that using an important fact: For each second your website load time increases, your online business will lose 7% of their customers. So, while three seconds may not seem like a lot of time, it can mean a 21% increase in sales, which can be the difference between a business breaking even or thriving.
