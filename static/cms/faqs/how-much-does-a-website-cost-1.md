question: How much does a website cost? 1
answer: "Asking the cost of a website is similar to asking the price of a house. How many bedrooms, which neighbourhood? There are too many variables to provide a blanket statement. For themed websites, our prices start at $800.00 and scale with complexity. Of course, we also offer custom websites and application development, starting at $1400.00 and $2000.00 respectively.\r\n\r\nRecurring costs are another topic completely. Generally speaking, there are three recurring costs associated with websites. Third-party resources, hosting and domains. Third-party resources can provide custom functionalities without requiring any programming, such as plugins and themes, and can range from free to about $70 / year for each resource. A domain is the URL of your site, cautioncreation.com is ours. Domains generally start at $15.00 / year. Hosting for a dynamic website can range from $5.00 / month to $300.00 / month, generally sitting at around $15.00 per month for smaller secure websites. Custom applications, particularly JAMstack applications, which are our specialty, are much cheaper to host and in some cases is actually free. Some custom applications require special servers and can become quite costly though.\r\n\r\nFor more information on which package is right for your business please visit our [development services](/development) page."
