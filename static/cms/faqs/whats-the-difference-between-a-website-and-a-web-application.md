question: What's the difference between a website and a web application?
---
Technically, websites are web applications, and web applications are websites. We would like to make a distinction so that we can refer individually to two vastly different but related pieces of software. Websites generally perform a variety of tasks for a business, such as providing information to users, displaying a contact form, hosting a blog, or in some cases, having an e-commerce store.



Web applications on the other hand perform a very specific task, such as video streaming services or providing a software as a service. The development time for websites is generally much lower than websites, and thus they are more affordable, but in many cases applications provide features that must be custom coded and are not readily available or easy to create with standard content management systems.
