question: How long does it take to develop a website? 1
answer: "At Caution Creation, we split our development into three categories. Themed development is the most straightforward and can be completed in 2 weeks under most circumstances. Custom development requires a bit more forethought, and thus the development time ranges from 2 weeks to 6 weeks depending on complexity. Application development can range from one month to, in some cases, a project that is in a state of constant development and improvements.\r\n\r\nOf course, you aren't on your own after we complete the development process. All of our contracts include an included maintenance period, where any issues and concerns you have with your website or application can be addressed and resolved without charge. After this maintenance period has concluded, we also offer monthly maintenance plans. For more information on the benefits of a monthly maintenance plan, visit our [maintenance services](/maintenance) page."
