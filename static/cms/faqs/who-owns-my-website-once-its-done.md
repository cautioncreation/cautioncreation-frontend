question: Who owns my website once it's done?
---
Ownership of software is a complicated subject, but we will do our best to demystify it for you a bit. You can split software into two categories: licensed software and custom software. Custom software is anything that is programmed by our developers, and licensed software is anything that isn't. Licensed software will be governed by a particular software distribution license, and any code attached to it will generally inherit that license. Fortunately, much of the software in the web development industry is open-source, which means there are very few limitations to what you can do with it. This means that you will own any code we produce ourselves, as well as the website as a whole, but the individual components not created by our developers will be governed by their individual licenses.
