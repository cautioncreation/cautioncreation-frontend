question: How much does a website cost?
answer: >-
  Asking the cost of a website is similar to asking the price of a house. How
  many bedrooms, which neighborhood? There are too many variables to provide a
  blanket statement. For themed websites, our prices start at $800.00 and scale
  with complexity. Of course, we also offer custom websites and application
  development, starting at $1400.00 and $2000.00 respectively. For more
  information on which package is right for your business please visit our
